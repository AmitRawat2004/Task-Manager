# Task-Manager
This is my personal project on a databaseConnection manager. 


The Task Manager is a Java-based console application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. The application allows users to add, view, update, delete, and complete tasks while storing all databaseConnection-related data in a MySQL database. It also includes features such as databaseConnection priority, duration tracking, and databaseConnection notes to enhance databaseConnection management.

The application follows a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) structure, using JDBC to interact with MySQL.
